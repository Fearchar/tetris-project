# GA Project 1: Tetris

## Overview

Tetris is a classic arcade puzzle game created by Alexey Leonidovich Pajitnov 1984, in which the player tessellates tiled blocks to score points, clear lines and stop the playing field from overflowing.

My Tetris project is the first solo project that I have completed as part of a General Assembly Software Engineering Immersive course. It was built over the course of one week, using a combination of JavaScript, HTML and CSS.

Give it a try [here!](https://fearchar.github.io/tetris-project/).

# The Brief

* Create a browser based version of the classic arcade game Tetris
* The game should stop if a Tetris block (tetrimino) fills the highest row of the game board
* The player should be able to rotate each block about its own axis
* If a line is completed it should be removed and the pieces above should take its place
